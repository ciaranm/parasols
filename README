Parallel Solvers
================

This is a collection of parallel solvers for hard problems. These are primarily
aimed at ``really hard'' instances, i.e. there are no sparseness restrictions,
and there are probably better (or at least much less memory-intensive)
solutions if your data is sparse.

You will need a C++11 compiler, such as GCC 4.7, to compile this. You will need
to specify CXX (or edit the Makefile) if your compiler is not named 'g++-4.7'.
You will also need Boost.

The solvers are as follows:

solve_max_clique
----------------

This solves the maximum clique problem.

To run, do './solve_max_clique algorithm filename.clq' where filename.clq is in
the DIMACS format, and algorithm is one of "naive mcsa1 tmcsa1 bmcsa1 tbmcsa1".
There are various options, use './solve_max_clique --help' to list them.

The output is as follows:

    size_of_max_clique number_of_nodes
    witness
    runtimes

Where the first runtime is the overall time (excluding reading in the graph) in
steady-clock ms, and any additional values are per-thread runtimes.

If work donation is enabled, a fourth line will show how many times this
happened. If a timeout is specified, the first line will also say 'aborted n',
where n is the number of queued nodes processed to completion.
